# Feature discretization

## class: scorecardbundle.feature_discretization.ChiMerge.ChiMerge

ChiMerge is a discretization algorithm introduced by Randy Kerber in "ChiMerge: Discretization of Numeric Attributes". It can transform a numerical features into categorical feature or reduce the number of intervals in a ordinal feature based on the feature's distribution and the target classes' relative frequencies in each interval. As a result, it keep statistically significantly different intervals and merge similar ones.

### Parameters

```mar
m: integer, optional(default=2)
    The number of adjacent intervals to compare during chi-squared test.

confidence_level: float, optional(default=0.9)
    The confidence level to determine the threshold for intervals to 
    be considered as different during the chi-square test.

max_intervals: int, optional(default=None)
    Specify the maximum number of intervals the discretized array will have.
    Sometimes (like when training a scorecard model) fewer intervals are 
    prefered. If do not need this option just set it to None.

min_intervals: int, optional(default=1)
    Specify the mininum number of intervals the discretized array will have.
    If do not need this option just set it to 1.

initial_intervals: int, optional(default=100)
    The original Chimerge algorithm starts by putting each unique value 
    in an interval and merging through a loop. This can be time-consumming 
    when sample size is large. 
    Set the initial_intervals option to values other than None (like 10 or 100) 
    will make the algorithm start at the number of intervals specified (the 
    initial intervals are generated using quantiles). This can greatly shorten 
    the run time. If do not need this option just set it to None.

delimiter: string, optional(default='~')
    The returned array will be an array of intervals that are closed to the right. 
    Each interval is representated by string (i.e. '1~2', which means (1,2]), 
    which takes the form lower+delimiter+upper. This parameter control the symbol that 
    connects the lower and upper boundaries.

output_boundary: boolean, optional(default=False)
    If output_boundary is set to True. This function will output the 
    unique upper  boundaries of discretized array. If it is set to False,
    This funciton will output the discretized array.
    For example, if it is set to True and the array is discretized into 
    3 groups (1,2),(2,3),(3,4), this funciton will output an array of 
    [1,3,4].
```

### Attributes

```
boundaries_: dict
    A dictionary that maps feature name to its merged boundaries.
fit_sample_size_: int
    The sampel size of fitted data.
transform_sample_size_:  int
    The sampel size of transformed data.
num_of_x_:  int
    The number of features.
columns_:  iterable
    An array of list of feature names.
```

### Methods

```
fit(X, y): 
    fit the ChiMerge algorithm to the feature.

transform(X): 
    transform the feature using the ChiMerge fitted.

fit_transform(X, y): 
    fit the ChiMerge algorithm to the feature and transform it.    
```

## function:  scorecardbundle.feature_discretization.FeatureIntervalAdjustment.plot_event_dist

Visualizing feature event rate distribution to facilitate explainability evaluation.

### Parameters

~~~
x:numpy.ndarray or pandas.DataFrame, shape (number of examples,)
    The feature to be visualized.

y:numpy.ndarray or pandas.DataFrame, shape (number of examples,)
    The Dependent variable.

delimiter: string, optional(default='~')
    The interval is representated by string (i.e. '1~2'), 
    which takes the form lower+delimiter+upper. This parameter 
    control the symbol that connects the lower and upper boundaries.   

title: Python string. Optional.
    The title of the plot. Default is ''.

x_label: Python string. Optional.
    The label of the feature. Default is ''.

y_label: Python string. Optional.
    The label of the dependent variable. Default is ''.

x_rotation: int. Optional.
    The degree of rotation of x-axis ticks. Default is 0.

xticks: Python list of strings. Optional.
    The tick labels on x-axis. Default is the unique values
    of x (in the format of Python string).

figure_height: int. Optional.
    The hight of the figure. Default is 4.

figure_width: int. Optional.
    The width of the figure. Default is 6.

save: boolean. Optional.
    Whether or not the figure is saved to a local positon.
    Default is False.

path: Python string. Optional.
    The local position path where the figure will be saved.
    This should be set when parameter save is True. Default is ''.

### Return

~~~
f1_ax1: matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot
        The figure object is returned.
