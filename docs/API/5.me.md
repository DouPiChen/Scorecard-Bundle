# Model evaluation

## class: scorecardbundle.model_evaluation.ModelEvaluation.BinaryTargets

Model evaluation for binary classification problem.

### Parameters

```
y_true: numpy.array, shape (number of examples,)
        The target column (or dependent variable).  

y_pred_proba: numpy.array, shape (number of examples,)
        The score or probability output by the model. The probability
        of y_true being 1 should increase as this value
        increases.   
        
        If Scorecard model's parameter "PDO" is negative, then the higher the 
        model scores, the higher the probability of y_pred being 1. This Function
        works fine. 

        However!!! if the parameter "PDO" is positive, then the higher 
        the model scores, the lower the probability of y_pred being 1. In this case,
        just put a negative sign before the scores array and pass `-scores` as parameter
        y_pred_proba of this function. 

output_path: string, optional(default=None)
        the location to save the plot, e.g. r'D:\\Work\\jupyter\\'.
```
