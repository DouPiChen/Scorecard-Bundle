# Feature selection

## function: scorecardbundle.feature_selection.FeatureSelection.selection_with_iv_corr()

Retrun a table of each feature' IV and their highly correlated features to help users select features.

## Parameters

```
trans_woe: scorecardbundle.feature_encoding.WOE.WOE_Encoder object,
        The fitted WOE_Encoder object

encoded_X: numpy.ndarray or pandas.DataFrame,
        The encoded features data

threshold_corr: float, optional(default=0.6)
        The threshold of Pearson correlation coefficient. Exceeding
        This threshold means the features are highly correlated.
```

## Return

```
result_selection: pandas.DataFrame,
        The table that contains 4 columns. column factor contains the 
        feature names, column IV contains the IV of features, 
        column woe_dict contains the WOE values of features and 
        column corr_with contains the feature that are highly correlated
        with this feature together with the correlation coefficients.
