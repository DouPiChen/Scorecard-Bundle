An High-level Scorecard Modeling API   



Scorecard-Bundle is a **high-level Scorecard modeling API** that is easy-to-use and **Scikit-Learn consistent**.  It covers the major steps to train a Scorecard model such as feature discretization with ChiMerge, WOE encoding, feature evaluation with information value and collinearity, and Logistic-Regression-based Scorecard model. All the transformer and model classes in Scorecard-Bundle comply with Scikit-Learn‘s fit-transform-predict convention.
